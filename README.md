# ComposeKittens


![Workflow result](https://github.com/timmyCoder/ComposeKitten/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
ComposeKittens is a Cat adoption app that lets you view a list of available cats that are up for adoption.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
Working on this challenge I have enjoyed:
- The ease that comes with translating designs into code
- Working with LazyColumns and not having to create adapters like I do in using a recyclerview
- The ease of handling screen navigation
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I am particularly proud of how easy it is to come up with complex designs easily
